[CLAIMS] [Claim 1 ] 
A fresnel lens arranged in front of a light emitting diode to convert an optical path of light emitted from the light emitting diode, a draft angle of the fresnel lens being identical to a radiation angle of the light whose optical path is converted by the fresnel lens. [Claim 2] 
An LED illuminating device comprising: a light emitting diode; and a fresnel lens arranged in front of the light emitting diode to convert an optical path of light emitted from the light emitting diode, wherein the fresnel lens has a draft angle identical to a radiation angle of the LED illuminating device. [Claim 3] The LED illuminating device according to claim 2, wherein the light emitting diode includes a blue light emitting diode for emitting blue light, the LED illuminating device further comprising: a fluorescent layer covering the light emitting diode and containing a cerium doped yttrium aluminum garnet(YAG:Ce) fluorescent material, the light emitted from the light emitting diode going through the fluorescent layer; and a light emitting diode cup in which the light emitting diode is placed, the light emitting diode cup reflecting light emitted laterally from the light emitting diode, in a forward direction.
